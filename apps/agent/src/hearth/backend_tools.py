"""Hearth — backend tools for the chat agent.

These are Python tools the LangGraph chat agent can invoke during a turn.
They differ from frontend tools (declared on the React side via
``useCopilotAction``) in that they execute in the Python process with
direct access to MoodProfile state and Gemini.

Two tools are exposed:

- ``classify_mood_for_goal(goal_text)`` — runs ``architect.classify_goal``
  and returns a ``Command`` that replaces ``state.profile`` with the
  fresh MoodProfile. Useful when the agent decides it needs a clean
  structured-output classification mid-conversation rather than emitting
  piecewise tool calls.

- ``regenerate_mood_profile(reason)`` — reads current ``state.profile``,
  runs ``architect.regenerate_for_reason`` (lever-id-disjoint regen),
  returns a ``Command`` that replaces the profile. This is the F-08
  mic-drop's deterministic path. The agent's prompt routes the user
  message ``"Regenerate the room: <reason>"`` here when wired.

Both tools fall back to presets on any failure (no key, schema fail,
quota) so the chat agent can never produce a broken state.

Wiring contract for runtime.py
------------------------------
::

    from hearth.backend_tools import make_hearth_backend_tools
    backend_tools = [*backend_tools, *make_hearth_backend_tools()]

The chat agent prompt (``MOOD_ARCHITECT_PROMPT``) already documents the
routing — when the user message starts with ``"Regenerate the room:"``,
it directs the agent to emit a fresh profile. With these tools wired,
the agent has a deterministic path for that emission.

Frontend tools are NOT redeclared here — see runtime.py docstring.
``updateLeverValue`` / ``addLever`` / ``swapScene`` /
``regenerateMoodProfile`` live on the React side and are forwarded to
the agent's tool list by ``CopilotKitMiddleware``.
